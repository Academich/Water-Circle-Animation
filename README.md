# Water Circle Animation
This jupyter notebook provides the animation of water circles of a figure based on a set of two-dimensional points.
The Huygens principle is used in the animation. Every given point is a centre of a growing circle. Circles from different points don't intersect.
The animation in interesting because wavefronts can be unusual.
For example, for non-convex figures the wavefront will never end up as a big circle, it will content some special points, so the wavefront will be non-convex too.
